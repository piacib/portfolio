# Welcome to my portfolio project!

I built this portfolio to showcase some of the different projects I have worked on throughout my frontend web development journey. I wanted to improve my abilities with css so I focused on adding animations to create a more interesting and interactive
experience.

## Why I built this project the way I did

I chose to use sass for this project because I had not used a preprocessor before and I felt it was a strong tool to
add to my repertoire. Overall, it greatly improved my development experience and the maintainability of my code.

## What to checkout

- [efficient sass loops](https://github.com/piacib/portfolio/blob/fdfb9f63bb829e77304bb45a173abe8bef016672/src/components/PageLoadAnimation/wave.scss#L50-L69)
- [maintainable and easily adjustable styling](https://github.com/piacib/portfolio/blob/fdfb9f63bb829e77304bb45a173abe8bef016672/src/components/Moon/moon.scss#L35-L72)
- [custom hook using Intersection Observers](https://github.com/piacib/portfolio/blob/main/src/utils/useDualFadeIn.ts)

## Future Improvments
In the future of this project I would like to experiment with complex CSS animations to further develop my undderstanding of them. Additionally, exploring various libraries such as three.js to implelement more intricate animations. Lastly, this project was built on create react app and I would like to convert it to vite.
